Student Management Application
Project Overview
This is a simple Student Management System developed in Java with MySQL as the database. It allows users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records, making it ideal for tracking student details such as name, ID, course, and grades.

Technologies Used
Java: Core logic and GUI (if using Java Swing/JavaFX).
MySQL: Database management for storing and retrieving student information.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For connecting Java to the MySQL database.
Features
Add Student: Create new student records with details like name, student ID, course, and grades.
View Student: Retrieve and display details of individual students.
Update Student: Modify information for existing student records.
Delete Student: Remove student records from the system.
List All Students: View a list of all students stored in the database.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure JDK is installed (version 8 or higher).
MySQL Server: Install MySQL and configure it locally.
JDBC Driver: Download and include the JDBC driver for MySQL in your project.
Database Setup
Open MySQL and create a database named student_management.
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE student_management;
Switch to the newly created database:
sql
Copy code
USE student_management;
Create a table for storing student details.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    student_id VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,
    course VARCHAR(50),
    grade VARCHAR(5)
);
Project Setup
Clone this repository or download the project files.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Add the MySQL JDBC driver to your project’s build path.
Update the database connection details in the code:
java
Copy code
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_management";
String user = "your_username";
String password = "your_password";
Running the Application
Compile and run the main class.
Use the application interface (if GUI) or the console (if CLI-based) to add, view, update, and delete student records.
Usage
Adding a Student: Enter student details (name, ID, course, and grade) to create a new record.
Viewing Student Data: Input a student’s ID to retrieve and display their information.
Updating Student Information: Modify any field of an existing student record.
Deleting a Student: Remove a student’s record from the database by entering their ID.
Listing All Students: Display all student records in a table format.
Future Enhancements
Search and Filter: Add features to filter students by course or grade.
User Authentication: Implement authentication for secure access.
Reports: Generate PDF reports of student performance.
